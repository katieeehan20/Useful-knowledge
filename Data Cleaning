# This is a note about the future of automation in data cleaning process



# Data scientists spend as much as 80% of their work time cleaning data. 

# Data cleaning involves tasks such as dealing with missing values, 
and so far these missing values have been filled out manually by subject matter experts who, 
by using statistical knowledge, they make educated guesses  about these missing values,
such as by using median or average of data in the dataset or by using predictive models. 
But automated techniques might work well at handling missing values.

# Oftentimes there's abstraction and no clear distinction in the data science lifecycle... 
There can be a continuum between multiple phases... of 1) data exploration, 2) data cleaning, and 3) data modelling...
And sometimes one is not sure how to clearly differentiate between these phases

# But clearly imposing arbitrary categorizations to these steps and 
defining boundaries between these phases is important to ensure that problems can be solved in modular and contained way. 

#There is a massive need of having pure data cleaning as Data Ops.

# There is still a continued need for putting in human expertise and feeding up the model... 
A data scientist's subject matter expertise might be necessary to communicate to the system, instead of looking for a full automation

#And even if automation in data cleaning sets in, people will not go jobless.
People will be able to focus on more important and more high-impact problems, thus things will be more efficient

# Useful things to learn : 
1) Learn about the history of how people managed database;
2) and learn about how structured data has evolved
