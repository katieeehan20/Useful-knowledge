How to avoid burnout when learning to code and facing difficulties:

1) Take some time to remind yourself about why you were first interested in learning to code. Perhaps this might mean taking a break from learning new concepts and instead focusing on practicing the skills you’re already comfortable with. By going back to the basics, your focus may be reignited.

2) Focus on not letting yourself get overwhelmed when faced with a difficult task. Instead, break out the whiteboard, and start by breaking down the task into simple steps. Then, ask yourself what the outcome of each step should be. Write out in English what you are trying to accomplish, and then translate it into code that you know well. It doesn't matter if it isn’t the perfect solution. You can go back and fix it later if you find a better way of doing things.

3) Set measurable goals. As much as the acronym makes me cringe, there is some logic behind setting specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely (SMART) goals. Breaking your learning goals into manageable chunks will help you focus your learning and will keep you from getting overwhelmed by the vast amount of knowledge you will eventually have to take in.
